# PHP Unit FTW

This repository is a simple example of using PHP Unit to test your module code on a drupal 7 install.

## Dependencies

You will need Composer to install PHP Unit. When you clone this repository use `composer install` to install the dependencies. I am currently using PHP 5.5 but anything 5.3+ probably will work as expected, ymmv.
